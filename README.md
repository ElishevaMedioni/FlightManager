# FlightManager
# Windows Systems Programming Project

💻 Desktop application that shows the flights entering 🛬 and leaving 🛫 Ben Gurion Airport in Tel Aviv.

The system was developed using the MVVM architecture, and the GUI using WPF.

Rest API's services we used in order to display flight data:

🌦 weather information by using OpenWeather

📆 "HebCal API" for retrieving alerts about weeks on which Israeli holidays falls upon

💾 We used Entity Framework to store and retrieve data

🖲 Command design pattern, Micro Frontends and User Controls pattern
